##Objective of the code is to create a text based adventure game. The game will take you through eight different
#   rooms and you will need to collect 6 items while going to each room. Type go north, go east, go west, go south,
#   grab flashlight, grab big foot track, grab wrench, grab shooting star, grab coffee, grab test tubes, exit, quit,
#   or show status. Anything else entered should return an Invalid entry statement and to try again.
##  In order to win you must collect all 6 items and then battle the scientist. You win if you have all 6 items and you
#   lose if you haven't collected all the items yet.
#  Use the Game Map for an easier walkthrough.
