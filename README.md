## Project Description
Abducted by Earthlings was the first working program I created from scratch in any coding language. It is a text-based adventure game written in Python. The player will navigate through different rooms in a secret alien facility, attempting to explore, collect items, and escape. This game does a great job of displaying my understanding of the fundamentals of Python and interactive programming.

## Main Concepts
- Dictionaries created to store room connections
- Decision branching
- Loops
- User input and validation

## How to Play
- Use the Game Map to help easily navigate from room to room
- Follow the onscreen instruction once the program is running
- Win by collecting the items and then battling the scientist.

## Future Improvements
- Add Front End visuals to go along with the game
- Add inventory and item interactions
- Include character selection

## Thank You
Thank you for checking out my first Python project!
I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoed building it!
